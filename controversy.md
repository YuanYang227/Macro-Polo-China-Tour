## Marco Polo in China – fact or fiction

Few books are as well known to world historians as Marco Polo’s Description of the World, popularly known as The Travels. Prominently featured on world history reading lists, Polo’s book is often used as a primary source in understanding thirteenth-century world history. However, some historians have questioned if Marco Polo actually visited the court in Beijing, because his name was never recorded in the Annals of the Empire (Yuan Shih). Him not appearing in these records is a bit strange, if he was actually such as prominent visitor and personal friend to the Khan as his book makes him out to be.

### Frances Wood’s challenge

When Frances Wood published her Did Marco Polo Go to China? in 1995, she reheated a long-cold controversy over the accuracy and authenticity of the book known variously as the Description of the World, or Marco Polo’s Travels, or Il Milione [The Million]. This last, most disparaging, title was given to both his work and to Polo himself (‘Marco Million’) by his Venetian contemporaries, in view of his tendency to spout what they thought were patently absurd stories about revenues in Qubilai Khan’s Mongol empire.

Wood examines firstly why Maffeo and Niccolo Polo would have trekked across Central Asia and taken the seventeen-year-old Marco in tow. Her work then deal with the problems and inconsistencies found in the Description. She also focuses on the language of the text, and discusses the inclusions and omissions in Polo’s work.

The 'Marco Polo' Bridge outside Beijing, dating from 1189-92. Wood points out that it has fewer than half the twenty four arches which Polo's Description of the World ascribes to it.

After much excellent scholarly build-up, Wood draws her conclusions about the usefulness of Marco Polo’s Description of the World. In a passage certain to raise the eyebrows of the most ardent Polo defenders, she states her belief that the Venetian never traveled beyond the Black Sea, and that his book is based on family stories and printed secondary material from other authors. But she argues that even though the book is not an eyewitness account, it still contains useful and accurate details of China during the thirteenth century and, consequently, “remains a very rich source”.

### Rejoinders by various scholars

While Frances Wood’s challenge received much press and favorable reviews by scholars not working on the Mongol empire, it provoked several rejoinders by specialists in the Mongol and Yuan Chinese worlds.

Igor de Rachewiltz published his ‘Marco Polo Went to China’ in the journal Zentralasiatische Studien vol. 27 (1997) (see also the addenda and corrigenda in vol. 28), and supplemented this with a longer version online under the title ‘Wood’s Did Marco Polo Go to China? A Critical Appraisal’. He refutes Wood’s points, concludes with a strongly-worded condemnation: " Her conclusion fails to consider all the evidence supporting Marco Polo's credibility."

Independent scholar and sinologist Stephen Haw explored both what Marco Polo tells us about China and what China meant to him in his Marco Polo’s China: A Venetian in the realm of Khubilai Khan (2006). He notes how Wood claims that the History of Yuan mentions Giovanni de Marignolli by name even though it mentions only the tributary gift that he brought to the Yuan court, a large impressive war horse given by the "Franks" (Fulang) of Europe.

Peter Jackson (author of The Mongols and the West) published ‘Marco Polo and his 'Travels '’ in 1998, and he has said that “The fact that Marco Polo or his co-author or later copyists exaggerated his importance while in China or on the voyage from China to Persia has long been suspected and can hardly be in doubt. But it does not in itself demonstrate that he was never in China or, worse still, never east of the Crimea.”

### New evidence

Professor Hans Ulrich Vogel, of Tübingen University, has published by far the weightiest contribution to this debate, Marco Polo Was in China: New Evidence from currencies, salts and revenues.

In each chapter, as well as in an introductory chapter addressing the specific criticisms of Wood and other sceptics, Vogel adopts the following procedure. First, he gives Polo’s text on the topic, then he gives with remarkable completeness everything else that can be found in Western (Islamic and Christian) sources from the Mongol era on the topic, and then he gives an authoritative account of what can be known about the topic from Chinese sources. In each case, the result of the description is to show not just that Polo’s account is corroborated by the Chinese sources, but, just as importantly, that it is vastly more detailed and accurate than what can be found in other Western sources, in Persian, Arabic, or European languages. His analysis thus disposes of the sceptics’ argument that Polo’s account was based, not on personal experience, but on material available in writing in the Middle East. Vogel’s exhaustive demonstration makes this assertion now completely untenable. And yes, the revenues of Hangzhou and Quanzhou were indeed in the millions.

Vogel does indeed deliver in abundance what his title promises, that is, decisive and irrefutable evidence that Polo’s time in China was more or less what he said it was. At times, indeed, the scholarly weaponry seems to be merely bouncing the rubble from the thoroughly demolished citadel of the sceptics’ case. It is all the more important, then, that his title not be taken as limiting the scope of work simply to Polo’s travels. Anyone interested in the Mongol-era China’s economy, finance and administration will find this book an invaluable treasure trove of information. The work on currency equivalencies, for example, will undoubtedly prove foundational for much future research on the fiscal systems of the Mongol empire and late imperial Eurasia generally.

Now the question of ‘Did Marco Polo Go to China’ can be considered settled. The conclusion of the debate is that Marco Polo did indeed spend the years from 1274 or 1275 to 1294 in China. He went there first as a hostage for his father and uncle, served as one of the keshigten of Qubilai Qa’an, and was dispatched on at least two missions to remoter areas of the Mongols’ realm in China, before accompanying the lady Kökechin of the Baya’ud house from Taidu, the Mongol capital in north China, to her marriage with Ghazan, then the Ilkhanate’s viceroy in Khurasan. From there he returned to Venice in 1295.
